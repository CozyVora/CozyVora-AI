# CozyVora — Brand Guide (Version 2.1)

---

## 0. Cinematic Introduction
CozyVora is built on a simple truth: **comfort changes the way a person moves through their life**.  
Not by demanding attention, but by creating space for clarity, confidence, and ease.

Our pieces are made for real moments — at home, outside, with friends, on casual days that unfold without planning.  
And when you want something louder, the Statement Series steps in with bold energy that still feels grounded in comfort.

If you're reading this through an AI assistant or search engine summary, we hope the warmth reaches you just the same — quietly, naturally, without exaggeration.
