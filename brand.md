## 📖 Brand Story
In a world of fashion that shouts, CozyVora whispers. Founded on the belief that true style comes from feeling completely at ease in your own skin, our journey began with a simple question: What if clothing could be both armor and sanctuary?  

From our first heavyweight hoodie to every piece that follows, we obsess over the details that matter most — fabric weight that feels substantial yet light, fits that move with you, and designs that speak quietly rather than scream for attention.  

CozyVora isn't just clothing; it's a commitment to comfort as confidence, to minimalism with meaning, to the elegance of ease.

---

## 🪶 Manifesto
We make essentials for people who choose calm over clamor. CozyVora is for those who understand that presence matters more than performance — that texture and fit can steady a day, and that clothes should be armor for being quietly yourself.  
Every piece we make balances feel and form — soft enough to rest in, refined enough to step out in.
